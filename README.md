This is an AI that supposed to play Black Jack casino game

This program uses a real model of cards nx52 so it can determine the victory and failure chance

every card plays are from the real card model and there is even an victory function that gives
feedback to the system so it can know when it has lost and when it has won

there is another model that deal cards exactly like the casino so the chances are real and 
the system can play in a real casino with the data it has acquired in this simulation
